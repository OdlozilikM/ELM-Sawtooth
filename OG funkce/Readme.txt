1) Run pedestal_fit.ipynb
2) Generate plots with `pedestal parameters scatterplots.ipynb`
3) Generate more plots with `analysis.ipynb`

That's all, folks :) Thanks for a great 2 weeks. - Magne


Notes
=====

The pedestal fit algorithm and the sawtooth extraction algorithm can 
both be visualized within their respective notebooks (pedestal_fit and 
sawtooths_extraction"
